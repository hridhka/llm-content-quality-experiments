# LLM Content Quality Experiments

## Overview

This repository contains small, focused experiments exploring how prompt design and iteration influence the clarity, structure, and educational effectiveness of content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal is not model training or fine-tuning, but understanding how prompt specificity and evaluation improve the usefulness of AI-generated explanations for learners.

## What This Project Focuses On

- Improving clarity and structure of AI-generated educational content  
- Evaluating LLM outputs from a learner’s perspective, not just correctness  
- Iterating on prompts to reduce ambiguity and cognitive load  
- Ensuring consistency and pedagogical effectiveness in explanations

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Improving an Educational Explanation  
**Topic:** Binary Search  

**Initial Issue:**  
The initial explanation was abstract, poorly sequenced, and assumed prior knowledge.

**Approach:**  
The prompt was refined to explicitly request:
- Step-by-step explanation  
- A simple numerical example  
- Clear sequencing of actions  

**Outcome:**  
- Improved clarity and readability  
- Better learning flow for beginners  
- Demonstrated how small prompt changes significantly improve educational quality

### Experiment 2: Evaluating Explanation Quality  
**Topic:** Time Complexity (Big-O Notation)  

**Initial Issue:**  
The explanation was technically correct but vague and difficult to intuitively understand.

**Approach:**  
The prompt was refined to request:
- Simplified language  
- Real-world analogies  
- Short, concrete examples  

**Outcome:**  
- More intuitive and learner-friendly explanations  
- Highlighted the importance of prompt specificity in educational contexts

## Key Learnings

- Prompt structure directly affects clarity and usefulness of LLM-generated content  
- Educational value increases when prompts guide tone, depth, and examples  
- AI output evaluation should prioritize learner understanding over raw correctness  

---

## Why This Matters

In AI-assisted education, unclear explanations increase cognitive load and hinder learning. This project addresses key challenges in educational AI systems:

- Reducing ambiguity in AI-generated explanations  
- Improving consistency and instructional clarity  
- Aligning AI outputs with real learner needs  

---

## Evaluation Criteria

AI-generated outputs were evaluated based on:
- Clarity for beginner learners  
- Logical sequencing of concepts  
- Use of examples or analogies  
- Overall learning flow and readability  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Prompt engineering and iteration  
- Qualitative evaluation of LLM outputs  
- Learner-centered content design  
- Documentation and structured experimentation  
- Critical analysis of AI-generated content
