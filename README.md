# LLM Content Quality Experiments

This repository documents small, focused experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate and improve the clarity, structure, and educational value of AI-generated content.

The goal is not model training, but understanding how prompt design and iteration affect the usefulness of AI explanations for learners.

## Experiment 1: Improving an Educational Explanation

**Topic:** Binary Search

### Initial Prompt
"Explain binary search."

### Issues Observed
- Explanation was abstract and assumed prior knowledge  
- Steps were not clearly sequenced  
- No example was provided, making it harder for beginners to follow  

### Improved Prompt
"Explain binary search step by step for a beginner. Use a simple numerical example and clearly describe each step of the process."

### Outcome
The improved prompt resulted in:
- A clearer step-by-step explanation  
- Inclusion of a concrete example  
- Better learning flow and readability  

This showed how small prompt changes significantly improve educational clarity.

## Experiment 2: Evaluating Explanation Quality

**Topic:** Time Complexity (Big-O Notation)

### Prompt Used
"Explain Big-O notation in simple terms."

### Observations
- Explanation was conceptually correct but vague  
- Lacked intuitive analogies  
- Did not connect the concept to real-world scenarios  

### Improvement Strategy
The prompt was refined to request:
- Real-world analogies  
- Short examples  
- Simplified language for non-technical learners  

### Outcome
The revised output was more intuitive and learner-friendly, demonstrating the importance of prompt specificity in educational contexts.

## Key Learnings

- Prompt structure directly affects clarity and usefulness of LLM-generated content  
- Educational value improves when prompts explicitly guide depth, tone, and examples  
- Evaluating AI outputs requires focusing on learner understanding, not just correctness

## Why This Matters

These experiments reflect core challenges in AI-assisted education:
- Reducing ambiguity in explanations  
- Improving consistency and clarity of AI-generated content  
- Aligning AI outputs with learner needs  

This work aligns with roles focused on AI content generation, prompt engineering, and quality evaluation.
